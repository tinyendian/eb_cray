description = """The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open-source, freely available software system for
 3D computer graphics, image processing and visualization. VTK consists of a C++ class library and several
 interpreted interface layers including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. VTK supports a wide variety of visualization
 algorithms including: scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling techniques
 such as: implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation.

This version of VTK has rendering turned off -- users can link against this library to leverage its algorithms 
but they will not be able to render.
